# vim

Daily driven Vim configuration.

I'm not interested in making Vim an IDE anymore. Vim is Vim. Over the years
I've realized my only challenge with Vim was portability. I wanted an answer to
the "when I shell on to a new machine" problem.

The answer was to stop installing plugins for everyting and simply learning
platform. Defaults aren't that bad if you just embrace them. What remains are
simply tweaks.
